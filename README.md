# LightTags
Handy way to store, add, remove and query, flags when we need more than 64.

Good things:

Handles can be created at compile time,
Querying multiple tags does not produce any branching.

In order to build the VSPRJ make sure to have 2019, and just run GenerateProjects.

LightTags.h is actual code, the rest is just for testing proposes, in case I want to change or expand the functionality in the future.
