# LightTags
Handy way to store, add, remove and query, flags when we need more than 64.

Good things:
Handles can be created at compile time and querying multiple tags does not produce any branching.

Notes:
In order to build the VS solution make sure to have 2019, and just run GenerateProjects.
LightTags.h is actual code, the rest is just for testing proposes in case I want to change or expand the functionality in the future.
